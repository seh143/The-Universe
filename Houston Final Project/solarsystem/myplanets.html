                        <p class="blueparagraph">
                            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the smallest planet in the Solar System, not much bigger than the Moon. If you were standing on Mercury the Sun would look about 3 times bigger in the sky. Mercury is a terrestrial or rocky planet,
                            like the Earth. It is made mainly of iron, and other heavy metals and has a rocky crust. The core of the planet reaches over halfway to the surface. It is the second most dense planet in our Solar System after the Earth. Mercury
                            is covered in craters like the Moon. Most of the craters were made billions of years ago when the Solar System was forming. Mercury is the only rocky planet which doesn't have volcanoes. This means that the ancient craters
                            can still be seen today as the surface has not changed much since its creation. It has no moon of its own. Mercury is small, about the size of the Moon. This means it has very little gravity and can't hold on to an atmosphere.
                            Instead, it has an exosphere. This is a very sparse layer of atoms, mainly captured from the Sun. With no atmosphere to help control the temperature Mercury lives with extremes. Day time temperatures can reach about 427 °C
                            dropping to almost -173 °C at night.

                        <p class="blueparagraph">
                            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. Like Mercury, Earth and Mars, Venus is a terrestrial planet. It has a solid surface and is mainly made of rock. Venus is the third smallest planet in the Solar System. It's similar in size to the Earth but a bit
                            smaller. Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky. Only the Moon is brighter. Venus has a thick toxic atmosphere. This is mostly made of carbon dioxide plus clouds of sulphuric acid. The thick clouds stop
                            heat from escaping and have caused a runaway greenhouse effect. This makes Venus the hottest planet in our Solar System even though Mercury is closer to the Sun! The temperature on the surface of Venus can get as high as 462
                            °C. Because Venus' atmosphere is so thick, the air pressure on the ground is more than 90 times that of Earth. You'd have to dive a mile down into Earth's ocean to feel a similar pressure! Venus has short years but very long
                            days. It only takes Venus 225 Earth-days to orbit the Sun, but it takes Venus 117 Earth-days to spin once on its axis. Because it's also moving around the Sun, a day on Venus lasts for 243 Earth-days! Venus is also unusual
                            because it spins on its axis backwards compared to the Earth. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.

                            Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the largest of four rocky, or terrestrial, planets. It is the only place in the Universe where we know life exists. Nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%) makes up most of the Earth's atmosphere. There are also tiny
                            amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gasses. Liquid water covers about 70% of the Earth's surface. Land covers the rest. The land is split into continents, islands, and polar regions. The polar regions are mostly
                            covered with ice. The inside of the Earth is split into layers. There is a solid iron core in the middle. This is surrounded by a liquid outer core. Around this is the mantle and a crust.

                            Mars is the fourth planet out from the Sun. It is also the second smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. Mars is a terrestrial planet like Earth. This means that it has a solid surface you could stand on. It is made of minerals, metals and
                            other elements that make up rock. Mars is often called the Red Planet. This is because it is covered with lots of iron oxide (or rust) giving it a reddish color. It has two tiny, potato-shaped moons called Phobos and Deimos.
                            Mars is about half the diameter of Earth. As it is smaller in both size and mass the gravity on Mars is about 40% of that on Earth. Mars has a thin atmosphere mainly made of carbon dioxide (95%), argon (2%) and nitrogen (2%).

                        <p class="blueparagraph">
                            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is more than twice as massive as all the other planets in our Solar System put together. It is so big that all the other planets would fit inside it! As huge as Jupiter
                            is, it is only a thousandth the mass of the Sun. And 11,000 planet Jupiter's could fit inside our star! Jupiter is a gas giant planet. This means that it does not have a solid surface. It is mostly made of gas and is thought
                            to have a small solid core. Jupiter is made up of mainly hydrogen (75%) and helium (24%). The light coloured bands of cloud are made of ammonia ice and are called zones. The darker coloured bands, or belts, are thought to be
                            made up of sulfur, and phosphorus. Jupiter spins faster than any other planet in the Solar System. One day on Jupiter is around 10 hours long! Even though it's day is much shorter than the Earth's, its year is longer. This
                            is because Jupiter is much further from the Sun. It takes 12 Earth years for Jupiter to go around the Sun once.

                        <p class="blueparagraph">
                            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System. Saturn is a gas giant planet like Jupiter and does not have a solid surface. It is made mainly of the gasses hydrogen and helium. Saturn is the only planet in our
                            Solar System with an average density which is lower than water. This means that if you could find a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float! Pieces of ice and rock orbit Saturn to make a system of 7 rings. Each ring orbits Saturn
                            at a different speed. The lumps of ice and rock in the rings range in size from a few centimeters to several meters across. Although the rings look impressive, they are only about 1 km thick. But they are very wide - 250,000
                            km in diameter! It has the second shortest day of the 8 planets. One day on Saturn is about 10 and a half hours! Much shorter than Earth's 24 hours. Saturn's axis is tilted by about 27 degrees. This is similar to Earth's tilt
                            of about 23 degrees which means Saturn also has seasons! But the seasons pass by much more slowly because it takes Saturn over 29 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Saturn has at least 82 moons. 53 of these have official names.
                            Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is bigger than Mercury and the dwarf planet Pluto! Titan is large enough to have its own atmosphere.

                        <p class="blueparagraph">
                            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is the third widest planet in our Solar System after Jupiter and Saturn. But Neptune has more mass than Uranus because Neptune is denser. Uranus is an ice giant, made of slushy liquid and ice, with a small
                            rocky core. Like Saturn, Uranus has rings, but Uranus' rings are fainter. The slushy ice on Uranus is made of methane, water and ammonia. Uranus also has a thin atmosphere made of hydrogen and helium, plus methane. The methane
                            gives the planet its blue-green color. Parts of Uranus' atmosphere are as cold as -220 °C, which is even colder than Neptune! The wind on Uranus can be as fast as 900 km per hour! Pictures of Uranus often show a smooth featureless
                            surface. But if we look at Uranus using infra-red light, we see bands of cold clouds and warmer spots. Uranus takes about 17 hours to spin once on its axis. Uranus is unusual because its equator tilted over 90° compared to
                            its orbit. This makes the planet look like it's spinning on its side. Uranus has 27 moons. Most of its moons are very small and orbit close to Uranus. The five largest are further out from the planet. They are called Miranda,
                            Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon.

                            Neptune is the furthest planet from the Sun. About 30 times further away than the Earth is. It is a blue giant planet like Uranus. These planets are also called ice giants. They are made of mostly water, methane and ammonia ice, with a small rocky core.
                            Neptune is about 30 times further away from the Sun than the Earth is. Here the average temperature is -200 degrees C. It is so far away that it is the only planet we can't see from Earth without the help of a telescope. The
                            planet is about 4 times as wide as the Earth. It is also titled on its axis, by about the same amount as the Earth. This means that the planet has seasons like we do - but each one on Neptune lasts over 40 years!

                            Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin,
                            but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Compared to Earth's moon, Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one
                            third its volume.
