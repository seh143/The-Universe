                    The Sun is a spherical ball of hot plasma, 1.4 million kilometers wide. This is more than 100 times wider than Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="blueparagraph">
                    It contains more than 99.8% of all the mass in the Solar System. The Sun is 75% hydrogen and almost 24% helium. These are the lightest chemical elements. They are also the most common elements in the Universe. The Sun also has small amounts of oxygen,
                    carbon, neon and iron. Nuclear reactions deep inside the Sun made these heavier elements.

                <p class="float blueparagraph">
                    There are three main parts to the Sun. The core at its center is the hottest part. Deep in the Sun's core, temperatures reach 15 million degrees Celsius! Around the core, is the radiative zone. Energy is carried through this area, away from the core,
                    as thermal radiation. Around that is the convective zone. Heat moves around this zone like soup bubbling in a pot. The visible layer of the Sun is called the photosphere. The temperature of the photosphere is about 6,000 degrees Celsius
                    and gives it its yellow color. The Sun also has an atmosphere. Some of the Sun's atmosphere escapes into space - we call this the solar wind.
                </p>
                <p class="blueparagraph">
                    It takes 50 million years for the Sun's energy to travel from the core to the surface. And then another 8 minutes for the light to reach us here on Earth! Scientists have worked out that the Sun is about 4,500 million years old. The Sun will carry on
                    shining for another 5,000 million years. This period of time is called its main sequence. It will then begin to run out of the nuclear fuel which powers its core and expand to a red giant star. Some stars explode once they run out
                    of fuel. The Sun is not big enough to explode. Instead, it will lose its outer layers over a long time - we call this a planetary nebula. The central mass of the Sun will shrink to a dense white dwarf. Finally, it will dim, stop shining,
                    and become a brown dwarf.
